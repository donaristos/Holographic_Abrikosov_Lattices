# Holographic Abrikosov Lattices

Welcome to the repository for the code used to generate the data as presented in ["Holographic Abrikosov Lattices"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11510) by A. Donos, J. Gauntlett and C. Pantelidou. The purpose was to construct the holographic duals of thermal field theorie states corresponding to superfluids subject to external magnetic fields.

These are field theory configurations which are parametrised by the shape of unit cell of the vortical lattice. One of the questions we answered is to find the shape that is t

The technical task involved the solution of Einstein's non-linear equations of motion coupled to a Maxwell field and a complex scalar. Due to the formation of a vortical lattice of electric currents, the resulting elliptical problem is three dimenional. This is a significant step up as compared to the project ["Holographic Lattice Conductivity"](https://github.com/donaristos/Holographic_Lattice_Conductivity.git) which is in two dimensions.
