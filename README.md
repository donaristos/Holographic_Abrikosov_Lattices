# Holographic Abrikosov Lattices

Welcome to the repository for the code used to generate the data as presented in ["Holographic Abrikosov Lattices"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11510) by A. Donos, J. Gauntlett and C. Pantelidou. The main purpose was to construct the holographic duals of thermal field theorie states corresponding to superfluids subject to external magnetic fields.

The technical task involved the solution of Einstein's non-linear equations of motion coupled to a Maxwell field and a complex scalar. Due to the formation of a vortical lattice of electric currents.
